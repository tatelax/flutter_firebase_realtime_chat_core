# README

This package is a fork of [flutter_firebase_chat_core](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_firebase_chat_core) to support Firebase Realtime DB instead of Firestore.

In theory, using Firebase Realtime DB for a chat app should result in lower cost due to the fact that Firestore charges based on the number of read/writes whereas Realtime DB charges based on bandwidth.
